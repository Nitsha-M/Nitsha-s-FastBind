Adds a menu with buttons to which you can bind any in-game command.

At the moment, only one command can be assigned to each button, but the functionality will be expanded in version 2.0!
# How to use
By default, the **FastBind** menu opens while you are pressing the `F8` key. You can switch pages using the `F7` and `F9` keys. (each key bind can be changed in the options)

## Update 3.1.0

## New
* **Icon selector update!** Now you can choose ANY item or block from the game, and even more — it also supports items from your installed mods!
* Now you can create as many pages and presets as you want! By default, there are 9 presets with 5 pages each.
* **New actions!** You can send a local chat message or show a title on screen. Actions support formatting, so you can make them look as beautiful as they should be! :3
* Full support for **Forge** and **NeoForge**.
* Support for Minecraft `1.21.9`/`1.21.10`
* Some redesign of the configuration menu

## Fixes & tech updates
* New UI components, such as a custom Text Field and a new action selection menu. These features are still new, so there may be bugs — feel free to report them
* Added Japanese translation. Thanks to `elinka47(PExPE3)`!
* Switched from Yarn mappings to MojMap (that’s why this update took a bit longer than I expected)
* Deleted the `/nitsha::welcome` command
* I fully rewrote the way the mod stores your binds. All your binds will migrate from v3.0 to v3.1, but if you're updating from v2.0 to v3.1, a new config will be created.
* New logo :3

If you have any ideas for a new type of action, I’ll be happy to hear them! You can share your ideas here:
